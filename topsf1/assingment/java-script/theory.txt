1. JavaScript Introduction

Q1: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web pages interactive.
It runs in the browser and allows dynamic content updates.

It handles user actions, form validation, animations, and communication with servers.
Q2: JavaScript runs mainly in browsers, while Python is commonly used for backend and data science, and Java is used for enterprise and Android apps.
Java is compiled and strongly typed, whereas JavaScript is interpreted and loosely typed.
JavaScript is primarily used for web interactivity.

Q3: The <script> tag is used to include JavaScript code inside an HTML file.
It can contain internal JavaScript or link an external .js file.
External file linking is done using: <script src="script.js"></script>.

2. Variables and Data Types

Q1: Variables store data values in JavaScript.
var is function-scoped, let is block-scoped, and const is block-scoped but cannot be reassigned.
Example: let age = 20;

Q2: JavaScript data types include String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Object, and Symbol.
Example: "Hello" (String), 25 (Number), true (Boolean).
Arrays and functions are special types of objects.

Q3: undefined means a variable is declared but not assigned a value.
null is an intentional empty value assigned by the programmer.
undefined is automatic, while null is manually set.

3. JavaScript Operators

Q1: Arithmetic operators perform math operations like +, -, *, /.
Comparison operators like ==, ===, >, < compare values.
Logical operators like &&, ||, ! combine conditions.

Q2: == compares values but allows type conversion.
=== compares both value and data type.
=== is stricter and recommended.

4. Control Flow (If-Else, Switch)

Q1: Control flow determines the order in which code executes.
if-else statements run code based on conditions.
Example: if (x > 0) { console.log("Positive"); }.

Q2: The switch statement checks a variable against multiple cases.
It is useful when comparing one value against many fixed options.
It improves readability over multiple if-else statements.

5. Loops (For, While, Do-While)

Q1: A for loop runs a set number of times.
A while loop runs while a condition is true.

A do-while loop runs at least once before checking the condition.
Q2: A while loop checks the condition first.
A do-while loop executes once before checking.
So do-while guarantees at least one execution.

6. Functions

Q1: Functions are reusable blocks of code.
Syntax: function greet() { console.log("Hi"); }.

They are called using the function name followed by parentheses.
Q2: A function declaration defines a named function.
A function expression stores a function inside a variable.
Function expressions are not hoisted like declarations.

Q3: Parameters are inputs passed into a function.
Return values send results back from the function.
Example: return a + b;.

7. Arrays

Q1: An array stores multiple values in a single variable.
Declared as: let arr = [1, 2, 3];.

Elements are accessed using index numbers starting from 0.
Q2: push() adds an element at the end.
pop() removes the last element.
shift() removes the first, and unshift() adds at the beginning.

8. Objects

Q1: An object stores data in key-value pairs.
Example: {name: "John", age: 25}.
Arrays use index numbers, while objects use property names.

Q2: Dot notation: obj.name.
Bracket notation: obj["name"].
Bracket notation is useful when property names are dynamic.

9. JavaScript Events

Q1: Events are actions like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements.
Event listeners detect and respond to these events.
They make web pages interactive.

Q2: addEventListener() attaches an event handler to an element.
Example: button.addEventListener("click", function(){ alert("Clicked"); });.
It allows multiple event handlers for the same event.

10. DOM Manipulation

Q1: The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the HTML structure as objects.
JavaScript interacts with the DOM to change content and styles.
It allows dynamic updates without reloading the page.

Q2: getElementById() selects an element by ID.
getElementsByClassName() selects elements by class name.
querySelector() selects the first matching CSS selector.

11. JavaScript Timing Events

Q1: setTimeout() runs code after a specified delay.
setInterval() runs code repeatedly at fixed intervals.
They are used for animations, clocks, and delayed actions.

Q2: Example:
setTimeout(function(){ alert("Hello"); }, 2000);
This displays a message after 2 seconds.

12. JavaScript Error Handling

Q1: Error handling manages runtime errors in code.
try tests code, catch handles errors, and finally runs regardless of error.
It prevents program crashes.

Q2: Error handling improves program stability and user experience.
It helps detect and manage unexpected issues.
It makes debugging and maintenance easier.
